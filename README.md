**Skill Checks** is my prototype of a simple game mechanic of quick time events in Dead by Daylight.
![screenshot](https://github.com/SemihMertSoysal/skill-checks/blob/main/example.gif)
- Adjustable skill check sizes.
- Randomized skill check pozitions.
- Determines the result by checking whether the indicator is between the required angles and triggers an event.
